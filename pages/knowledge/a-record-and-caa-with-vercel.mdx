Vercel is currently testing the [Anycast methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anycast) for DNS and routing.

## Required DNS Records

The following records are required:

- Add an A record with the value `76.76.21.21`.
- Add a CAA record on the root of your domain with the value `"0 issue letsencrypt.org"`.

If you followed the instructions above successfully, your domain should be available for use on any Vercel project that you own.
