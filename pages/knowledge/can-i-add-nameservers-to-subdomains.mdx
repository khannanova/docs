The Vercel platform does not support Nameservers on subdomains (subzone delegation). We recommend customers with this specific need to use another DNS provider.
You can still use [A records](/knowledge/a-record-and-caa-with-vercel) with your domain to host your site with Vercel while the Nameservers are managed by a 3rd party company.
